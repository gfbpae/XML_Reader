# XML_Reader
During my summer internship, I undertook the task of designing an interface that displays and allows editing of an XML file. Leveraging the PugiXML library, I successfully completed this project. To integrate the PugiXML library into the Qt Creator, I opted for cmake instead of qmake for the compilation process.

The interface, as shown in the attached images, provides users with the capability to visualize and modify XML files. The use of PugiXML facilitated efficient XML parsing and manipulation within the Qt Creator environment. The project showcases a clean and user-friendly interface, making XML file interaction more accessible.
